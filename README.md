My solutions (both Python and Rust) for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about).

### Rules this year
* Don't rush the leaderboard, starting time doesn't matter
* Solve all problems before day 25
* No checking Internet before solved (treat it as a "job interview")
* Use the same algorithm for implementations in all languages
* Initial solutions made in Jupyter lab (see the [notebooks](notebooks) folder), then factored into a folder structure

### Running

Rust:
```
$ cd rust && ./run.sh
```

Python:
```
$ cd python && ./run.sh
```

There are also corresponding Jupyter notebooks for both Python and Rust.
